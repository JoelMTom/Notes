### Depth First Search
---
- In [[Depth First Search|DFS]], the exploration of a vertex $v$ is suspended as soon as a new vertex is reached.
- At this time the exploration of the new vertex $u$ begins. When this new vertex has been explored, the exploration of $v$ continues. The search terminates when all reached vertices have been fully explored.
