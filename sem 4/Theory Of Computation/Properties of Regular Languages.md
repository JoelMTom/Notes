### The Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages

#### Theorem: The pumping lemma for regular languages

>[!INFO]
>Let $L$ be a regular language. Then there exist a constant n$($which depends on $L)$ such that for every string $w$ in $L$ such that $|w| \geq n$, we can break $w$ into three strings, $w = xyz$, such that:
>1. $y \neq \epsilon$
>2. $|xy| \leq n$
>3. For all $k \geq 0$, the string $xy^kz$ is also in L
