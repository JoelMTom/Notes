##### Theorem: 
> [!Info]
> If $L$ and $M$ are regular languages, then so is $L \cup M$.

Proof:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&Since\ L\ and\ M\ are\ regular,\ they\ have\ regular\\ &expressions;\ say\ L\ =\ L(R)\ and\ M\ =\ L(S).\\
&Then\ L \cup M\ =\ L(R+S)\ by\ the\ definition\ of\ the\\ 
&+ operator\ for\ regular\ expressions. 
\end{aligned}
$$
