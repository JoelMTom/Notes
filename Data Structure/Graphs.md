## Graph
---
$G =\ <V,E>$
$V$ = Set of vertex
$E$ = set of edges

### Graph Implementation

- Adjacency List
	- Directed: $n + m$
	- Undirected: $n+2m$

- Adjacency Matrix
	- Directed: $n^2$
	- Undirected: $n^2$

### Graph Terminology
- Path
- Topological Sort
- Strong Connectivity
- Transitive Closure
